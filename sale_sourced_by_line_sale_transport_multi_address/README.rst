Sale Address Management with multiple warehouse sourcing
========================================================

Description
===========

This module updates the way the origin address (from
`sale_transport_multi_address`) is computed when `sale_sourced_by_line` is
installed: since the latter allows specifying a warehouse on the sale order
line, we take that address into account when computing the origin address.
